# clGray-Scott
OpenCL code to run the Gray-Scott model for chemical pattern formation

This repository contains the OpenCL code that runs the model describing spatial self-organisation and pattern formation in interacting chemicals, as published in the papers:

Gray, P., and S. K. Scott. 1983. Autocatalytic reactions in the isothermal, continuous stirred tank reactor - isolas and other forms of multistability. Chemical Engineering Science 38:29-43.

Pearson, J. E. 1993. Complex Patterns in a Simple System. Science 261:189-192.

Lee, K. J., W. McCormick, Q. Ouyang, and H. L. Swinney. 1993. Pattern formation by interacting chemical fronts. Science 261:192-192.

An video of the output of the model can be found on: https://youtu.be/vVzBj717oDE This video has been produced by the code in this repository.

To run this model, read the explanation on the main page https://johanvandekoppel.github.io.
